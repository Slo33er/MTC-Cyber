<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 21/10/2025</p>

<p>MTC Cyber (“we”, “us”, “our”) respects your privacy and is committed to handling personal information in a transparent and secure way.</p>

<h2>What we collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Details you provide via the form: <em>business name, website/domain, your name, email, and notes</em>.</li>
  <li>Operational metadata: dates/times we received your request and when we sent your snapshot.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why we collect it (purposes)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To perform your <em>Cyber Readiness Snapshot</em> and send you results.</li>
  <li>To contact you about findings, recommended fixes, or a requested consultation.</li>
  <li>To maintain basic records for administration, compliance, and dispute resolution.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How we collect it</h2>
<p>Directly from you when you submit the form on <code>mtccyber.com.au</code>. We do not require logins or internal system access for the snapshot.</p>

<h2>Public scanning only</h2>
<p>Our snapshot uses <em>publicly available</em> information (e.g., SSL/TLS status, security headers, exposed ports, known breach mentions, CMS versions). We do <strong>not</strong> bypass security controls or attempt intrusive testing.</p>

<h2>Legal basis & consent</h2>
<p>We rely on your request/consent to provide the snapshot and our legitimate business interests in operating and improving our services.</p>

<h2>Where your data is stored</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Website hosting:</strong> GitHub Pages (static site).</li>
  <li><strong>Form submissions:</strong> Formspree (acts as our message processor) which may store/process data outside Australia. See their privacy documentation.</li>
  <li><strong>Email/records:</strong> Our business email and local records for administration.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sharing & third-party processors</h2>
<p>We do not sell your data. We share it only with service providers we use to run our business (e.g., Formspree for form delivery, email service providers). They are bound by their own privacy terms and process data on our behalf.</p>

<h2>International transfers</h2>
<p>Because some providers host services overseas, your information may be transferred and stored outside Australia. We select reputable providers and limit what we collect.</p>

<h2>Retention</h2>
<p>We keep snapshot requests and correspondence for up to <strong>12 months</strong> unless you ask us to delete earlier, or longer if required for legal/accounting purposes.</p>

<h2>Your choices</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Ask for a copy, correction, or deletion of your personal information.</li>
  <li>Opt out of follow-up emails about paid services at any time.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cookies & analytics</h2>
<p>We currently do <strong>not</strong> use analytics cookies or tracking pixels on the site. If this changes, we will update this policy and provide controls.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>We use reasonable technical and organisational measures (e.g., TLS, access controls) and only collect what we need to deliver the snapshot. If a data breach is likely to cause serious harm, we will notify affected individuals and regulators in line with the Notifiable Data Breaches scheme.</p>

<h2>Children</h2>
<p>Our services are for business customers; we do not knowingly collect information from children.</p>

<h2>Complaints</h2>

<h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
<p>We may update this policy. We’ll post the new version here with a new “Last updated” date.</p>
